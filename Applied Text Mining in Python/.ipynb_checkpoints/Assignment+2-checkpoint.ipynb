       " 'On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose .',\n",
       " 'Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the New England hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched .',\n",

       " 'A boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .',\n",
       " 'Yet was there a sort of indefinite , half-attained , unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant .',\n",

       " 'The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane ; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads .',\n",
       " 'The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears .',\n",

       " 'The liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously .',\n",

       " 'Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all .',\n",
       " 'But , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on .',\n",
       " 'Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag .',\n",
       " 'He now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise .',\n",
       " 'There was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead .',\n",

       " 'In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him .',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms .',\n",
       " \"As I live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years ' War , and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt .\",\n",
       " 'Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms .',\n",

       " \"Going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ' old Congo baby .\",\n",
       " 'Remembering the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner .',\n",

       " 'For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place , and removing the papered fire-board , sets up this little hunch-backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons .',\n",
       " 'The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol .',\n",
       " 'I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow .',\n",
       " 'First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze .',\n",
       " 'Presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ) , he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro .',\n",
       " 'But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips .',\n",
       " 'All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner .',\n",
       " 'At last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock .',\n",
       " 'All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound .',\n",
       " 'But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one .',\n",
       " 'Taking up his tomahawk from the table , he examined the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke .',\n",
       " 'The next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .',\n",

       " \"Upon waking next morning about daylight , I found Queequeg 's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner .\",\n",
       " 'You had almost thought I had been his wife .',\n",
       " 'The counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt .',\n",
       " 'Indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke , I could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me .',\n",
       " 'My sensations were strange .',\n",
       " 'Let me try to explain them .',\n",
       " 'When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I never could entirely settle .',\n",
       " 'The circumstance was this .',\n",
       " \"I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless , -- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere .\",\n",
       " 'I felt dreadfully .',\n",
       " 'But there was no help for it , so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets .',\n",
       " 'I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection .',\n",
       " 'Sixteen hours in bed !',\n",
       " 'the small of my back ached to think of it .',\n",
       " 'And it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house .',\n",
       " 'I felt worse and worse -- at last I got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time .',\n",
       " 'But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back I had to go to my room .',\n",
       " 'For several hours I lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes .',\n",
       " 'At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- I opened my eyes , and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness .',\n",
       " 'Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine .',\n",
       " 'My arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my bed-side .',\n",
       " 'For what seemed ages piled on ages , I lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken .',\n",
       " 'I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , I shudderingly remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery .',\n",
       " 'Nay , to this very hour , I often puzzle myself with it .',\n",
       " \"Now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg 's pagan arm thrown round me .\",\n",
       " \"But at length all the past night 's events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament .\",\n",
       " 'For though I tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain .',\n",
       " \"I now strove to rouse him -- '' Queequeg ! ''\",\n",
       " '-- but his only answer was a snore .',\n",
       " 'I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch .',\n",
       " \"Throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage 's side , as if it were a hatchet-faced baby .\",\n",
       " 'A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk !',\n",
       " '`` Queequeg !',\n",
       " \"-- in the name of goodness , Queequeg , wake ! ''\",\n",
       " 'At length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , I succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike-staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him .',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile , I lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature .',\n",
       " 'When , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself .',\n",
       " 'Thinks I , Queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are .',\n",
       " 'I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while I was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding .',\n",
       " \"Nevertheless , a man like Queequeg you do n't see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .\",\n",
       " 'He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots .',\n",
       " 'What under the heavens he did it for , I can not tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots .',\n",
       " 'But Queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly .',\n",
       " 'He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners .',\n",
       " 'His education was not yet completed .',\n",
       " 'He was an undergraduate .',\n",
       " 'If he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on .',\n",
       " 'At last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .',\n",
       " 'Seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; I begged him as well as I could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible .',\n",
       " 'He complied , and then proceeded to wash himself .',\n",
       " 'At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands .',\n",
       " 'He then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face .',\n",
       " 'I was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks .',\n",
       " \"Thinks I , Queequeg , this is using Rogers 's best cutlery with a vengeance .\",\n",
       " 'Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept .',\n",
       " \"The rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal 's baton .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER 5 Breakfast .',\n",
       " 'I quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly .',\n",
       " 'I cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow .',\n",
       " \"However , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more 's the pity .\",\n",
       " 'So , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way .',\n",
       " 'And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for .',\n",
       " 'The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at .',\n",
       " 'They were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns .',\n",
       " 'You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore .',\n",
       " \"This young fellow 's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he can not have been three days landed from his Indian voyage .\",\n",
       " 'That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him .',\n",
       " 'In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore .',\n",
       " 'But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ?',\n",
       " \"which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone .\",\n",
       " \"`` Grub , ho ! ''\",\n",
       " 'now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast .',\n",
       " 'They say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self-possessed in company .',\n",
       " 'Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor .',\n",
       " \"But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of Africa , which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances -- this kind of travel , I say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish .\",\n",
       " 'Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .',\n",
       " 'These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence .',\n",
       " 'And not only that , but they looked embarrassed .',\n",
       " 'Yes , here were a set of sea-dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains .',\n",
       " 'A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !',\n",
       " 'But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle .',\n",
       " 'To be sure I can not say much for his breeding .',\n",
       " 'His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him .',\n",
       " \"But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people 's estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly .\",\n",
       " \"We will not speak of all Queequeg 's peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare .\",\n",
       " 'Enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk-pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll .',\n",

       " 'If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford .',\n",

       " 'I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain .',\n",
       " 'Yes , it was the famous Father Mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite .',\n",
       " 'He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry .',\n",
       " \"At the time I now write of , Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February 's snow .\",\n",
       " 'No one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led .',\n",
       " 'When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed .',\n",
       " 'However , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit .',\n",
       " 'Like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea .',\n",
       " 'The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste .',\n",
       " 'Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel .',\n",
       " 'The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth-covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint .',\n",
       " 'At my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary .',\n",
       " 'For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec .',\n",
       " 'I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this .',\n",
       " 'Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage .',\n",
       " 'No , thought I , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen .',\n",
       " 'Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?',\n",
       " 'Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a self-containing stronghold -- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls .',\n",
       " \"But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain 's former sea-farings .\",\n",
       " 'Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .',\n",
       " \"But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel 's face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship 's tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory 's plank where Nelson fell .\",\n",
       " \"`` Ah , noble ship , '' the angel seemed to say , `` beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo !\",\n",

       " 'Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture .',\n",

       " \"-- for the pulpit is ever this earth 's foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world .\",\n",

       " \"He paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit 's bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea .\",\n",
       " \"This ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog -- in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy -- '' The ribs and terrors in the whale , Arched over me a dismal gloom , While all God 's sun-lit waves rolled by , And lift me deepening down to doom .\",\n",
       " '`` I saw the opening maw of hell , With endless pains and sorrows there ; Which none but they that feel can tell -- Oh , I was plunging to despair .',\n",
       " '`` In black distress , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my complaints -- No more the whale did me confine .',\n",

       " '`` My song for ever shall record That terrible , that joyful hour ; I give the glory to my God , His all the mercy and the power .',\n",
       " 'Nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm .',\n",
       " \"A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : `` Beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah -- 'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah .
